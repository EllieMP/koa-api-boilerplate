# KoaJS HTTP API Boilerplate

This is a boilerplate code repository for building a HTTP API using KoaJS, a modern web framework for Node.js. It provides a starting point for building scalable and maintainable APIs.

## Features

- Lightweight and expressive middleware framework.
- Asynchronous control flow with the use of `async/await`.
- Simplified error handling with powerful error propagation.
- Extensible and composable through middleware.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed on your system:

- Node.js (version 12 or above)
- npm (Node Package Manager) or yarn

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/koa-http-api-boilerplate.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project's directory:

   ```bash
   cd koa-http-api-boilerplate
   ```

3. Install the dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

   or

   ```bash
   yarn
   ```

4. Start the development server:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   or

   ```bash
   yarn dev
   ```

   This will start the server and automatically reload it whenever you make changes to the code.

5. Open your browser and visit `http://localhost:3000` to see the API in action.

## Folder Structure

The project structure is organized as follows:

- `src/` - Contains the source code of the API.
  - `controllers/` - Holds the route handlers/controllers for various endpoints.
  - `middlewares/` - Contains custom middleware functions.
  - `routes/` - Defines the API routes and their corresponding controllers.
  - `app.js` - Entry point of the application.
- `config/` - Stores configuration files.
- `tests/` - Contains test files.
- `index.js` - The main file that starts the server.

## Customization

Feel free to customize the boilerplate according to your specific project requirements. Here are a few suggestions:

- Add or modify routes in the `src/routes` directory.
- Implement additional middleware functions in the `src/middlewares` directory.
- Extend the error handling logic in the `src/middlewares/errorHandler.js` file.
- Modify the server configuration in the `config` directory.

## Testing

You can write tests for your API using a testing framework like Jest or Mocha. This boilerplate provides a basic test setup using Jest. To run the tests, use the following command:

```bash
npm test
```

or

```bash
yarn test
```

## Deployment

To deploy your KoaJS API to a production environment, you can follow the guidelines provided by your hosting service. Here are a few suggestions:

- Configure environment-specific settings in the `config` directory.
- Use a process manager like PM2 or Supervisor to manage the application in a production server.
- Set up a reverse proxy (e.g., Nginx) to handle incoming HTTP traffic.
